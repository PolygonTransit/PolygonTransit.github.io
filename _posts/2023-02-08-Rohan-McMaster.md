The owner of Lunie Vids (formerly Victransport) and 8 News (Rohan McMaster) has been sexualising netball players (most under 13 years old) without consent. This is not okay. Some affected players have been contacted.

Please boycott 8 News, Lunie Vids and any other of his channels. ~~Lets be honest, the videos are shit anyway~~. For legal reasons that was a joke.

Message for McMaster: The Victorian Railway community all want you to fuck off the internet and go get a life.
PS: A rebrand wont remove your reputation as a perv.
PPS: There is no point censoring this site. It has been seen, screenshotted and archived on the Internet Archive.
