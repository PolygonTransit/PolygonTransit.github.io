The owner of Lunie Vids (formerly Victransport) and 8 News (Rohan McMaster) has been sexualising netball players (most under 13 years old) without consent. This is not okay. Some affected players have been contacted.

Please boycott 8 News, Lunie Vids and any other of his channels. ~~Lets be honest, the videos are shit anyway~~. For legal reasons that was a joke.

Message for McMaster: The Victorian Railway community all want you to fuck off the internet and go get a life.
PS: A rebrand wont remove your reputation as a perv.
PPS: There is no point censoring this site. It has been seen, screenshotted and archived on the Internet Archive.

The majority of us don’t accept him as part of the Victorian railway community, we want to distant ourselves as far as possible from this person - Budgie
I support the vic transport youtube channel as much as i support fair renting laws (i have 728 negatively geared properties) - Zac
